# Building Modern Web Apps with Rust and WebAssembly

The web development landscape is evolving rapidly, and Rust with WebAssembly (WASM) is at the forefront of this revolution. This powerful combination brings near-native performance to web applications while maintaining the safety guarantees that Rust is known for.

## Why Rust and WebAssembly?

Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency make it an ideal candidate for WebAssembly compilation. Unlike JavaScript, Rust code compiled to WASM can run at near-native speeds in the browser.

### Performance Benefits

WebAssembly modules can execute 10-20x faster than equivalent JavaScript code for computationally intensive tasks. This makes it perfect for:

- Image and video processing
- Games and simulations  
- Cryptographic operations
- Scientific computing

## Getting Started with Rust and WASM

Let's build a simple Rust function and compile it to WebAssembly:

<CodeBlock
  code={`// lib.rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
extern "C" {
    fn alert(s: &str);
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) {
    alert(&format!("Hello, {}!", name));
}

// A more complex example: Fibonacci calculation
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}`}
  language="rust"
/>

## Setting Up the Build Process

To compile Rust to WebAssembly, you'll need `wasm-pack`:

<CodeBlock
  code={`# Install wasm-pack
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh

# Create a new Rust library
cargo new --lib my-wasm-project
cd my-wasm-project

# Add to Cargo.toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

# Build the WebAssembly module
wasm-pack build --target web`}
  language="bash"
/>

## Real-World Applications

Major companies are already leveraging Rust and WebAssembly in production:

- **Figma** uses WASM for their high-performance design tools
- **Discord** improved performance of their client with Rust
- **Dropbox** rewrote their file storage engine in Rust

    }
  ]}
/>

## Best Practices

When working with Rust and WebAssembly:

- **Keep interfaces simple**: Minimize data transfer between JS and WASM
- **Use appropriate data types**: Stick to primitives when possible
- **Profile your code**: Not everything needs to be in WASM
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Plan for WASM module loading failures

## The Future of Web Development

As WebAssembly continues to evolve with features like:

- **WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)**: Standard system calls
- **Multi-threading support**: Shared memory and atomics
- **Garbage Collection**: Better integration with high-level languages

The combination of Rust and WebAssembly will become even more powerful, potentially reshaping how we think about web application architecture.

## Conclusion

Rust and WebAssembly represent a significant step forward in web development, offering the performance of native applications with the accessibility of the web. While the ecosystem is still maturing, early adopters are already seeing substantial benefits in performance-critical applications.

The future of the web is faster, safer, and more efficientâ€”and Rust with WebAssembly is leading the way.
